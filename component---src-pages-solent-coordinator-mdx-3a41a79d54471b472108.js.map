At this point, students are aware of a selection of IBM technologies they might consider, and of the principles and activities behind some Enterprise Design Thinking.\nIn the presentation, we expect to see a user-need and initial concept played back.\nThen, we critiqued each student’s work so far.\nThe adoption of design thinking I saw at this stage was really make-or-break - since the onus of choosing a user, building empathy, establishing pain points and ideation is all taken individually and in isolation. I enjoyed probing all this thinking they had done, and gently steering them back on track to creating user-centred outcomes.\nConcepts must be pitched either within or as an extension to an existing brand - which can make choosing a user or problem to start from really challenging. `}</p>\n    <h3>{`Evaluation`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Evaluating the research and concepts of each student was really challenging, but essentially came down to how well we felt they’d taken the focus on empathy and real user insights to their brand of choice.\nAlmost all students needed encouragement to go out and speak to real users. The majority of students managed to identify real user needs from what research they had done, and using Enterprise Design Thinking methods.\nThe majority of the guidance and feedback we offered was on the IBM technology they should research, and how ambitious their concepts should be. `}</p>\n    <h3>{`Concept development presentations and mentor matching`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Early in the students’ second semester we invite them to Hursley for a tour of the studio and to meet their mentors.\nI expected recruiting mentors to be challenging, but it proved to be really easy.\nOn this day, students who chose to continue with the IBM brief and develop their concepts presented their projects so far.\nWorking with the course director, we elected each student an IBM mentor and provided a level of feedback.\nI set up a slack channel and various support for mentors to ensure that we all offered a similar level of support through the rest of the year.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Supporting mentors`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Through the remainder of the project year I’ve liased with mentors and with the course director.\nAs mentors all come from different IBM disciplines, we chat regularly about how the projects are shaped by us, how to maintain effective ‘mentor’ relationships, and share resources.\nThe effect of the Covid-19 outbreak on the students has been really interesting, but I have been pleased to see mentors and students surpassing the expectations of their course lead consistently.\nThe creativity of students in terms of adopting free online tools and communicating their design decisions in written documents has been really exciting. `}</p>\n    <h2>{`Business Impact`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Maintaining the partnership with a local university, even in a non-typical industry such as fashion, strengthens IBM’s contribution to the local community.\nDesigners both within and outside of IBM benefit from the creative use of Enterprise Design Thinking and feel invigorated by the project.\nSeveral students have gained accreditation with EDT badges including the Team Essentials for AI course.\nProjects students complete are great candidates for the promotion of IBM at events and exhibitions. `}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
