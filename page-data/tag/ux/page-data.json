It's a key method IBM is using to align a huge number and range of user experiences. However, we realised that there is more to a consistent experience than colour, components, font, style and illustrations. As such, I've been involved in designing several UX patterns for common user flows or actions. These patterns are now in use by product teams all over IBM."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/design-reviewing","categorySlug":"/category/ibm-design-language/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Design reviewing for IBM Design consistency","date":"2020-10-08T22:40:32.169Z","category":"IBM Design Language","description":"IBM comprises a huge range of products with experiences for many different user roles. One of the ways that we ensure high quality and consistent interfaces is with Designed User Experience reviews. I really enjoy being a member of the reviewing panel, and feel that it's a great way to learn about different user problems.
