Since the statement was so verbose, we could all come up with much more specific versions, linked to specific demographics. Our ideas loosely grouped into 4 groups around enabling a workforce through and after COVID-19:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pandemic as opportunity:</strong> How might we encourage people to be fluid with their job roles - into volunteering, into start-ups - and become more resilient as a result?</li>\n<li><strong>Recovery:</strong> How might we shepherd people into roles particularly important for economic recovery after COVID-19?</li>\n<li><strong>Survival:</strong> How might we prevent the loss of jobs in the first place during the crisis?</li>\n<li><strong>Skills:</strong> How might we better provide/direct skills education? How might we direct large groups into education/roles specific for them?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"\" alt=\"Delving into the How might we statement and which users we&#x27;d like to focus on.\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"users\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#users\" aria-label=\"users permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Users</h3>\n<p>We then brainstormed the users that we wanted to aim at. There were a few themes, which aligned with what we’d heard of COVID-19 experiences in the press. By converging again, we spotted that a lot of our identified users had an “unconventional” employment status - whether freelance, entrepreneurs, self-employed or in a transition. In hindsight, what we created may have been more of an Archetype. The other group of users we initially identified were entry-level workers in the hospitality industry.</p>\n<h3 id=\"validation\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#validation\" aria-label=\"validation permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Validation</h3>\n<p>One of my favourite things about this project was how fast we moved to validate the experiences of the user groups we identified. By the second day, we had in-depth interview insights from 8 individuals which fell into our two archetypes.</p>\n<p><img src=\"\" alt=\"Some of the insights we generated from 8 user interviews across our two archetypes.\"></p>\n<p>I then led a clustering activity of insights, using colour-coding to track the research source to the theme. We found that across the non-conventional worker archetype, themes emerged. Many themes also transcended geographies, although we were aware that we would need to reality-check our ideas across continents and communities. I was pleased to see that insights were consistent across interviewees - as until this point I had been uncomfortable with the team’s assumptions and stereotypes based on each continent’s perceived affluence. A really poignant insight was that non-conventional workers feel under-represented by government and industry support, and under-catered for by services and products.</p>\n<p><img src=\"\" alt=\"Insights proved consistent across interviewees.\"></p>\n<p>We decided to move forward with the non-conventional worker because we’d collected far more insights for that archetype than the hospitality worker. We created a persona, dragging insights directly on to the empathy map, and then filled in the gaps to bring him to life.</p>\n<h3 id=\"as-is-scenario\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#as-is-scenario\" aria-label=\"as is scenario permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>As-is scenario</h3>\n<p><img src=\"\" alt=\"Our as-is scenario proved challenging.\"></p>\n<p>The as-is scenario proved one of the hardest parts of our week. While we’d established a lot of data about our desired user, we hadn’t understood that user trying to achieve the task we’d chosen. While our persona, William, explored starting his own business as a result of COVID-19, none of our interviewees had. This meant that a lot of our as-is scenario was filled out with general, non-task related insights, assumption, and our own limited experience.  </p>\n<p>A major learning point for me here, was that sometimes not just person-based generative research is required, but also task-based research. I guess often in my project work, I’m iterating on existing experience, so this second type of research is implicit.</p>\n<h3 id=\"needs-statements\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#needs-statements\" aria-label=\"needs statements permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Needs statements</h3>\n<p>Three themes came across in brainstorming our needs statements.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>IT and technology needs</li>\n<li>Access to new skills education</li>\n<li>Planning and executing an industry-standard business plan  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>We certainly felt that the second and third needs were actionable by us as a team.
