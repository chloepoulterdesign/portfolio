I’ve also become really interested in how the sales and marketing tracks of products, paks, platforms and services interplay to generate revenue while maintaining a consistent brand image.</p>\n<p>Beyond Discover, Learn, Try and Buy I also regularly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>raise awareness of the Cloud &#x26; Cognitive for Carbon, and Carbon Community patterns which teams should follow</li>\n<li>encourage teams to recommend and contribute UX patterns to Carbon and Carbon for Cloud &#x26; Cognitive</li>\n<li>encourage adding personality to products through helpful content and illustration</li>\n<li>direct teams to guidance on fully adopting Carbon</li>\n<li>highlight interactions or flows that might confuse new users (such as myself)</li>\n<li>identify overlap in feature, terminology, or interactions in other IBM products</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I really value DUX reviewing for the introduction it has given me to so many other products, experiences, markets and teams. </p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/design-reviewing","tagSlugs":["/tag/ux/","/tag/design/","/tag/design-consistency/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-10-08T22:40:32.169Z","description":"IBM comprises a huge range of products with experiences for many different user roles.
