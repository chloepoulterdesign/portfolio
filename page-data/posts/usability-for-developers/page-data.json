I think it’s important that what is essentially a checklist for avoiding bad practice isn’t seen as a replacement for a thorough design process.  </p>\n<p>I then introduce each heuristic with at least one example from the real internet world. For example, I introduce the “Visibility of system status” heuristic by discussing the variety of sounds twitter uses to reflect the status of a tweet.</p>\n<h3 id=\"some-of-my-other-favourite-examples-include\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#some-of-my-other-favourite-examples-include\" aria-label=\"some of my other favourite examples include permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Some of my other favourite examples include:</h3>\n<p><strong>Match between system and real world:</strong> Medium’s highlight interaction<br>\nMedium’s highlighting interaction is an interesting example of matching between your system and the real world. This is a heuristic that isn’t hugely popular these days - unlike the start of the apple movement, when skeumorphism tried to represent all digital interfaces as their pre-digital counterpart, we’re very minimalist in the 2020s. However, I think Medium have done a great job of striking the balance here between introducing a non digital concept to their system, without unnecessary complexity or tackiness.  </p>\n<p><strong>Consistency and standards</strong><br>\nI enjoy talking about the “like” interaction as essentially a standard of the web today. I extend this to Google’s failed social platform and suggest that the “+1” mechanic they used rather than the “like” might be what deterred potential adopters.  </p>\n<p>I conclude the talk with some of the ways that the usability heuristics are employed by design teams - including reviews, evaluations, or checklists, sharing screenshots of such documents. To loop back to my introduction, I recognise that the usability heuristics isn’t a driving force for innovation, but suggest that in conjunction with websites such as collectui.co, they can be a good way to brainstorm alternative methods for meeting the user’s needs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"feedback-ive-received\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#feedback-ive-received\" aria-label=\"feedback ive received permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Feedback i’ve received</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“(enjoyed) the activity and the hand out; liked how you made it applicable to IBM offerings and not generic which helped with participant engagement”   </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“It was a complete new approach and way of thinking to me”  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The handouts were great!”</p>\n</blockquote>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/usability-for-developers","tagSlugs":["/tag/ux/","/tag/design/","/tag/workshops/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-09-01T22:40:32.169Z","description":"Heuristics for developers are sessions I run as an introduction to design for development teams.
