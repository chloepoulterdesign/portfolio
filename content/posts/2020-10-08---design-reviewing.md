## Summary
IBM comprises a huge range of products with experiences for many different user roles. One of the ways that we ensure high quality and consistent interfaces is with Designed User Experience reviews. I really enjoy being a member of the reviewing panel, and feel that it's a great way to learn about different user problems. I get to meet lots and lots of design and product teams, all over the world, too!


## Role
As a member of the Design and User experience review committee, I work with a team to check the release readiness of experiences in Cloud Paks, on Cloud Platform, and more.

So far, I have reviewed 7 products for Discover, Learn, Try and Buy experience quality. 
Some of the regular themes in the feedback I provide concern:
- embedding the Cloud Pak strategy into all product messaging
- including the customer voice in marketing and messaging with easy-to-consume stats on the impact of the product
- facilitating the digital routes to trial, purchase, and implementation that modern consumers expect in home (and work) environments
- engaging with potential customers to understand their needs and likely non-branded search terms

Reviewing the discovery of products has certainly taught me a lot about SEO. I've also become really interested in how the sales and marketing tracks of products, paks, platforms and services interplay to generate revenue while maintaining a consistent brand image.

Beyond Discover, Learn, Try and Buy I also regularly:
- raise awareness of the Cloud & Cognitive for Carbon, and Carbon Community patterns which teams should follow
- encourage teams to recommend and contribute UX patterns to Carbon and Carbon for Cloud & Cognitive
- encourage adding personality to products through helpful content and illustration
- direct teams to guidance on fully adopting Carbon
- highlight interactions or flows that might confuse new users (such as myself)
- identify overlap in feature, terminology, or interactions in other IBM products

I really value DUX reviewing for the introduction it has given me to so many other products, experiences, markets and teams.
