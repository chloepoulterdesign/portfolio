## What is the IBM Cloud Pak for Integration?
The IBM Cloud Pak for Integration comprises IBM’s integration products (Event Streams, MQ, App Connect, API Connect, Aspera and Data Power). The focus of the team is to streamline workflows of teams and businesses using multiple IBM integration technologies.

### Cloud pak objectives
1. Allow and encourage users to explore and use integration technologies they’ve not used before.
2. Understand the way that software development teams are organised and are changing in industry.
3. Facilitate cooperation between IBM product teams to create a consistent user experience.
