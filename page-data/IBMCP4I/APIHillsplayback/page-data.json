We aimed for a couple of years in the future so that our designs weren't constrained by the current state of the UI. \n\nI tried to provide insights from my sprint experience in Event Streams when recruiting team members. I advised on an Offering Management decider, but found that our real acting decider in the week would be a very technical Program Director because he really enjoyed working with design. \nThis reinforced the idea that sprints really must be team-directed for me.  \n\nThe other influence I was glad I had, was to push for a dedicated facilitator. \nWe learnt in Event Streams that self-facilitation was really challenging, and team members who supported with facilitation struggled to engage in either role as much as they wanted. \nAs a result, we were really lucky to have Tom Waterton facilitate the Hello World week. This allowed all of us team members to focus on the sprint content. \nI envied Tom's ability as dedicated facilitator to put his foot down, time activities, and steer us out of black holes. \n\n### Expert interviews\nOne practice I really encouraged the group to follow from the Design Sprint format was the Expert Interviews on day 1.  \nThis was for two reasons:\n\n1. We had a lot of strong personalities we needed to get bought into our sprint outcome. By inviting them to share their opinions we really started a positive dialogue and timeboxed their involvement.\n\n1. There is a tonne of domain knowledge in any project we do - so giving over a total of 3 hours to listening and absorbing 6 different takes on the problem space felt really good.\n\nAfter the expert interviews, we had an updated and amended journey map for an integration developer looking to get their first piece of value in an integration environment. \nWe worked really hard to avoid UI specific terms in the map - so that it wasn't tied to current day UI.\n\n<Row>\n  <Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Updated and amended journey map](Images/The_map.jpg)\n\n  </Column>\n</Row>\n\nIn this sprint, I really learnt the value of \"How Might We\" notes as a note-taking method as well as launching us straight into ideation.  \n\n### Lightning demos\n\nWe found Lightning demos really hard in the Event Streams sprint, so I voiced concerns about them all the way from the planning stage of this sprint. \nWe asked some of our experts for their favourite competitive ideas. We also started talking about, and noting ideas for, the Lightning demos from the very beginning of day 1.\n\nWe looked at the Event Streams starter application - and identified that it didn't meet the Hello World definition because the code it was based on couldn't be used as a starting point for development. \nWe also looked at lots of smaller interactions we liked. My favourite Lightning demos was a really familiar interaction in video games - where the 'learning' parts of the game achieve the first few achievements or story points.\n\n<Row>\n  <Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Inspiration themes we took from Lightning demos](Images/Inspiration.jpg)\n\n  </Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Google Ventures' sketching method\n\nThe sprint methodology uses a really prescriptive sketching method, which is designed to get you diverging, converging, diverging and converging again within a 3-hour sketching period. \nI'm a big fan of it personally, but have found that IBMers are much happier using big ideas, storyboarding, and to-be scenario maps. \nThat said, we ended up with a really strong \"Art gallery\" of ideas and enjoyed voting on them with our decider. \n\n<Row>\n  <Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Voting on our Art Gallery of ideas](Images/Reviewing_ideas_4.jpg)\n\n  </Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Sudo-user tests\n\nAfter a gruelling day of prototyping, we got to our sudo-user testing. We operated this in a lab-style format where the test was broadcast to the sprint room by our researcher. \n\nWe captured feedback on every screen from every test, using a post-it colour code:  \n*Green* for positive,  \n*Yellow* for neutral comment or general observation,  \nand *Red* for a negative comment.  \n\n<Row>\n  <Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Feedback on some of our screens in user tests](Images/Feedback.jpg)\n\n  </Column>\n</Row>\n\nWe would have loved to interview real users about our prototype, but it was sufficiently radical that we weren't sure who they would be. \nOur prototype represented a lot more than just a Hello World experience - in making it work, we had designed a whole future for a single-UI integration offering.  \n\nOur stakeholders formed most of our sudo-users, and had some great feedback, so whether or not our model for a Hello World comes to life, we drove alignment for the long-term vision of IBM Cloud Pak for Integration and our integration offerings.\n\n> This is the first time we're providing an actual cross-product integration platform experience, rather than just a thin veneer.\n\n> You have created a 'Hello, World!' but also created a better authoring experience.","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"5d9c1f5131aa9813bd93446b875a9d29","counter":106,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Create & expose APIs Hills playback spike","description":"Documentation of the Hills playback spike I facilitated in the IBM Cloud Pak for Integration team."},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Create & expose APIs Hills playback spike\ndescription: Documentation of the Hills playback spike I facilitated in the IBM Cloud Pak for Integration team.\n---\n\n## Summary\nThe Cloud Pak for Integration brings together five integration offerings and streamlines workflows to value through them using a common navigation.  \nWithin an initiative to \"integrate\" these integration stories, we analysed the as-is flow of creating and exposing an API through the Cloud Pak, and aligned on the direction that the unified UI should take to perform this task.  \n\n### Preparation\nI prepared for the sprint by collecting and commissioning screenshots of the existing workflow.
