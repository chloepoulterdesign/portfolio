description: "As a Natural Language Processing company, Aveni needed to respond fast to the release of ChatGPT, the fastest-spreading product launch the world had ever seen. Providing UX advice while we constructed demos and PoCs very fast and without user experience at the core was challenging. The project helped me develop opinions about healthy rules and boundaries for lean innovation."
