Other mentors adopted this strategy too.\n- **Introducing Information Hierarchy.** \nThis was a challenging item to introduce - and I started with a pedagogic statement that it needed doing. \nOnce the student appreciated the condensation of menu items and navigation, its value was clear, but I'd like to introduce this differently in future, perhaps by suggesting a critique of the student's chosen brand navigation. \n- **Giving a crash course in usability testing.** Establishing context with the participant, recording results, and improving testing quality were all subjects we spoke about. I encouraged the student to document her research plans as well as her outcomes in her write-ups.\n- **Project direction.** Encouraging the student to push the project in the direction they feel is valuable. \nWith so many things to research, read up on, prototype, create and document, I feel that the most valuable addition I make as mentor is to encourage the student to achieve and create the things that would secure their projects' future. As such, I've encouraged her to take a dragons' den mindset, and made the Business Model Canvas avaialable as a tool for balancing all the financial, technical and design compoents of the project. \n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"606ee79099060bc8bd00b51be19e7bea","counter":96,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Mentor"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Mentor\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nThis page describes the work I have done as mentor on the MA Creative Direction course at Southampton Solent University. \n\n</PageDescription>\n\nAs a mentor to a MA Creative Direction for Fashion and Beauty student, I've had a variety of experiences:\n\n- **Introducing to design tools.** Particularly with the effect of the Covid-19 outbreak, I've introduced my Mentee to a variety of design tools including Sketch, Marvel, and Mural.\n- **Enterprise Design Thinking education.** Explaining design thinking methods in a business-relevant way has been a core role.
