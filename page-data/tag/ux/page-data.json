It's a key method IBM is using to align a huge number and range of user experiences. However, we realised that there is more to a consistent experience than colour, components, font, style and illustrations. As such, I've been involved in designing several UX patterns for common user flows or actions. These patterns are now in use by product teams all over IBM."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/usability-for-developers","categorySlug":"/category/workshops/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Usability workshops for developers","date":"2019-09-01T22:40:32.169Z","category":"Workshops","description":"Heuristics for developers are sessions I run as an introduction to design for development teams.
