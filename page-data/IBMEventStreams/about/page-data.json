Apache Kafka is an immensely popular messaging software which was released by the Apache foundation in 2011. The Event Streams team provide Kafka as software and as a service and add fully supported capabilities such as an award-winning UI, schema registry, REST API and connector library.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n## Role\n\nUser Experience Designer\n\n## Objectives\n\n1. Enable IT Administrators and Developers to connect their applications with Event Streams.\n\n1. Maintain a current User Experience within the IBM Design Language that is consistent with other IBM products.\n\n1.

We created an interface to make the set up of Kafka Connect much easier and have strengthened it through several releases. \n\n**[Lightweight, efficient browsing of messages](https://chloepoulterdesign.github.io/portfolio/IBMEventStreams/MessageBrowser)**  \nMessages (events) travelling through, are the core of the Event Streams (Kafka) concept. Following user feedback that our message browser consumed a lot of resources, we redesigned it to achieve the same value in a much lighter way.","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"34b0ec1ec3dcc2481c345ea6b1da70b5","counter":98,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"IBM Event Streams - about","description":"An introduction to the IBM Event Streams project"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: IBM Event Streams - about\ndescription: An introduction to the IBM Event Streams project\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nIBM Event Streams is IBM's Apache Kafka offering.
