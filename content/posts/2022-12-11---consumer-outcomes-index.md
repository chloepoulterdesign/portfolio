description: "When the FCA launched the Consumer Duty - a new regulation entirely revolutionising the way Financial services approach customers - firms were struggling to act on vague guidance. We worked quickly to apply what we'd built for Quality Assurance users of Aveni, to measure the ways advisers were performing their duty to consumers in calls. I designed the proposition, project managed the team and curated the go-to-market strategy."
