## Summary
IBM comprises a huge range of products with experiences for many different user roles. One of the ways that we ensure high quality and consistent interfaces is with Designed User Experience reviews. I really enjoy being a member of the reviewing panel, and feel that it's a great way to learn about different user problems. I get to meet lots and lots of design and product teams, all over the world, too!
