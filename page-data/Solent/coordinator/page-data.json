The creative director isn't a role we often (or ever!) interact with, so seeing how students adopt our tools and methods is always new and inspiring.\n- **The brief is very open to interpretation.** Without specific deliverables required, the module emphasis is on documenting creative decisions and learning. This means that we get to enjoy a huge variety in outcomes from advertising campaign mockups to app design prototypes to 3-dimensional product development.\n\n## As project coordinator, I've enjoyed the following experiences in 2019/2020:\n\n### Concept reviews - December 2019\n\nIn december of the students' first semester, we met to watch a presentation on each concept and provide feedback. At this point, students are aware of a selection of IBM technologies they might consider, and of the principles and activities behind some Enterprise Design Thinking. \nIn the presentation, we expect to see a user-need and initial concept played back. \nThen, we critiqued each student's work so far. \nThe adoption of design thinking I saw at this stage was really make-or-break - since the onus of choosing a user, building empathy, establishing pain points and ideation is all taken individually and in isolation. I enjoyed probing all this thinking they had done, and gently steering them back on track to creating user-centred outcomes. \nConcepts must be pitched either within or as an extension to an existing brand - which can make choosing a user or problem to start from really challenging. \n\n### Evaluation\n\nEvaluating the research and concepts of each student was really challenging, but essentially came down to how well we felt they'd taken the focus on empathy and real user insights to their brand of choice.\nAlmost all students needed encouragement to go out and speak to real users. The majority of students managed to identify real user needs from what research they had done, and using Enterprise Design Thinking methods.\nThe majority of the guidance and feedback we offered was on the IBM technology they should research, and how ambitious their concepts should be. \n\n### Concept development presentations and mentor matching\n\nEarly in the students' second semester we invite them to Hursley for a tour of the studio and to meet their mentors. \nI expected recruiting mentors to be challenging, but it proved to be really easy. \nOn this day, students who chose to continue with the IBM brief and develop their concepts presented their projects so far. \nWorking with the course director, we elected each student an IBM mentor and provided a level of feedback. \nI set up a slack channel and various support for mentors to ensure that we all offered a similar level of support through the rest of the year.\n\n### Supporting mentors\n\nThrough the remainder of the project year I've liased with mentors and with the course director. \nAs mentors all come from different IBM disciplines, we chat regularly about how the projects are shaped by us, how to maintain effective 'mentor' relationships, and share resources. \nThe effect of the Covid-19 outbreak on the students has been really interesting, but I have been pleased to see mentors and students surpassing the expectations of their course lead consistently. \nThe creativity of students in terms of adopting free online tools and communicating their design decisions in written documents has been really exciting. \n\n## Business Impact\nMaintaining the partnership with a local university, even in a non-typical industry such as fashion, strengthens IBM's contribution to the local community. \nDesigners both within and outside of IBM benefit from the creative use of Enterprise Design Thinking and feel invigorated by the project. \nSeveral students have gained accreditation with EDT badges including the Team Essentials for AI course. \nProjects students complete are great candidates for the promotion of IBM at events and exhibitions. \n\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"c4c5798ec5051083dcabb0c3509ea872","counter":235,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Project coordinator"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Project coordinator\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nThis section explains my involvment as mentor and coordinator of the Creative Direction brief on the Southamptopn Solent MA Creative Direction for Fashion and Beauty course. \n\n</PageDescription>\n\nMA Creative direction for Fashion and Beauty is one of the most popular postgraduate courses on offer at Southampton Solent University. \nThe university is located less than 10 miles from IBM Hursley and we enjoy a long-running relationship with students who undertake the \"IBM Technology\" brief as part of their Creative Direction module. \n\nThe course information page can be accessed [here](https://www.solent.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/creative-direction-for-fashion-and-beauty-ma).\n\nStudents study creative direction from fashion and beauty backgrounds with the aim of extending their practice into creative direction roles for brands, media, and more. \nThe creative direction module that IBM is involved with allows students to self-direct a project which interacts with an IBM technology, using newly acquired design thinking skills which we introduce in the first semester. \nA combination of design thinking, user-centred design, business of design, and technology skills are encouraged through the year in informal lectures and mentoring relationships. \n\nAs coordinator I work with the course leader and other IBMers to structure the support and partnership we offer to students.
